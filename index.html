    <strong class="section1">Shooting is a favorite hobby of mine. I enjoy it because there is always room for improvement and it can invovle a great deal of competition.
            I first began shooting when I was 10 years old. I started with small weapons such as a .22 caliber rifle and worked my way up from there. Once I began accurate with smaller weapons I eventually moved up to 12 guage shotguns.
            After shotguns and rifles came the hanguns. This is where it became difficult because there is a larger room for error and its easy to make mistakes.

    <strong class="section2"> <h1>Handguns can be very different from long guns. Long guns are generally more accurate than handguns and are often eaiser to handle.
                  I enjoy shooting handguns more because there are so many different aspects that go into hitting your target. Usually I will start from the 3 or 7 yard line to try and get a good group started. After I start to get on target, I will move back to the 12 yard line.
                  Once I am at the 12 yard line, I usually try to keep my group in the 8-10 ring, center mass. Most handgun fights will occur inside 15 yards so I find this a good place to work on accuracy.
                  My choice of hangun is a Glock. I prefer a .40 caliber. Glocks are very dependable and have been the choice for many law enforcement agencies for years.

    <strong class="section3"> Skeet shooting is also something I enjoy doing. This involves what are known as clay pigeons. Usually a machine will launch one or more clay pigeons in the air and the shooter tries to hit it as fast as they can before it lands on the ground.
                This is a popluar competition among gun clubs and is even an event in the Olympics. Skeet shooting is a great way to have fun and competition with your friends on the weekends.
